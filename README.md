# 15-112-Term-Project
Final project for 15-112 course

My term project is a game that is inspired by Guitar Hero, but also incorporates aspects of a scroller game, such as having a moveable character,
power ups, and enemies. It also incorporates an audio analysis aspect so that it can take any music file that is put in the ‘Songs’ directory and analyze it to create the game. This means that all the notes, the way the notes are
spread and the speed at which the notes move are all generated by analyzing the music file. 

For external modules, my project uses pygame, aubio and audiotools to run. All these modules can be found on source forge, and pygame can also be found on the pygame website, then users can follow the instructions provided in the downloaded modules about how to install the modules. My project also imports sys, wave, os, string, copy and random but all of those should already be present.
